## My process

### Built with

- [react](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles
- [react-intersection-observer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-intersection-observer) - For triggering animations once

### What I learned

I learned how to build a `useInterval` linear-gradient background which adds a smooth animated background button, although I am not really proud of the result, it's good for a start. I also implemented for the first time a `react-intersection-observer` delay-chained animation series on the initial load. This is not a pixel perfect solution, but it's something. I found it a bit challenging implementing the whole responsiveness.
